# AdaptiveMultiplext

In an adaptive network, we change the connection between nodes by attention to their state. For example, in the SIS model, a susceptible node cut its connection from its infected neighbor and connects to other susceptible nodes with w probability.  For a better understanding read Gross 2006.

In this project, we simulate a two-layer multiplex network. On the above layer, we use the Watts Threshold model and on the other layer, we apply the SIS model to the adaptive networks.

We aim to see if the active nodes change their connection by w probability, how much does the density of the infected nodes gets changed?

I illustrate my result by matplotlib in python.

I usually try to my code get easy to learn more:)
